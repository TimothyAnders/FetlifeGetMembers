Fetlife Quick Script  
--------------------  
Browsing 'kinksters' can be tedious, especially if you're only interested in users under a certain label (E.G sub).  
This script allows you to search users in a city, and categorize them based on gender, label, ETC. Then you can do whatever you want with the results, such as viewing their profile.  


# Quick Start   
1) In a browser open fetlife and navigate to viewing kinksters in whichever city   
2) Copy the URL   
3) Change `URL_TO_VIEW_KINKSTERS` URL in the supplied script    
4) Run the script in the browser console     
5) Once the script is finished, type `allUsers` into the browsers console to get the results.  
6) Copy and paste the results
